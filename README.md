# TalentedClassic
WoW addon. A replacement to the default talent UI that allows creation of templates and viewing of all trees at once.

This was an addon originally written by "Jerry" (URL: https://www.wowinterface.com/downloads/info12593-Talented.html). The project is since abandoned, so I adapted old code to form this version.

**Feature List (adapted from original page)**

    See the complete talent tree on a single frame.
    Create and view templates for all classes.
    Apply complete templates with a single click, after a talent wipe.
    Share your current build with others, or any template you've made.
    Import and export templates directly from Wowhead.
    A macro command /talented apply <template> allows automatic application of a template based on its name.

**Known issues and planned fixes**

    Hunter pet talents do not work
    Potential issues with importing talent builds from Wowhead.

**License**

This addon is given under a CC BY license and its creators assume no responsibility for anything that goes wrong due to the addon's use. However, note that Blizzard's stipulations means that addon development is effectively, inherently NC-SA, too. You cannot make money by building addons for someone else's product, friends!
